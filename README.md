# üß∞ Installation

## Prerequisites

- Linux or macOS
- Node v12 LTS
- Globally `yarn` & `nest` commands
- Docker

Install yarn packages before continue

```bash
yarn
```

## Setting up PostgreSQL database

- This is will make a new PostgreSQL running in the standard port `5432`
- Please shutdown any previous conflicting PostgreSQL instances before starting
  this

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Check the database is up

```bash
docker logs -f local_db
```

Check that you can log into a database with `psql`

```bash
docker exec -it local_db psql -U local_dev local_db
```

View tables

```psql
\dt
```

## Creating the initial database

Run initial migrations to set up initial database tables

```bash
yarn typeorm migration:run
```

# ‚å® Development

## ‚öô Running the app

```bash
# development
yarn start

# watch mode
yarn start:dev

# production mode
yarn start:prod
```

## üéÆ Playground & ü©∫ Health check

After the application starts, go to `http://localhost:$PORT/health` to check
health indicators statuses or `http://localhost:$PORT/graphql` to access graphql
playground

Observartion: You must change `$PORT` for the port to be used in your
environment

## üß™ Running tests

```bash
# unit tests
yarn test

# e2e tests
yarn test:e2e

# test coverage
yarn test:cov
```

After executing `yarn test:cov`, the `coverage` folder will be generated with
coverage details

## üìè Lint

Linting codebase

```bash
# issues are automatically fixed
yarn lint
```

# üß≥ Migrations

Run `typeorm` CLI

## Automatically generating migrations

You can generate migration files

1. Update entity source code
2. You have an up-to-date local development database

```bash
# creates a file under src/migrations/
yarn typeorm migration:generate -n MigrationName
```

## Apply migrations against the local database

```bash
yarn typeorm migration:run
```

Check the result of migrations using `psql` command-line tool

```bash
docker exec -it local_db psql -U local_dev local_db
```

```psql
\d 'todo'
```

# üìñ Documentation

Generating codebase documentation(served at `http://127.0.0.1:8080`)

```bash
yarn doc
```

# üì¶ Building

Before building application to production, make sure environment variables are
applied correctly

Building for production

```bash
yarn build
```

Running on production

```bash
yarn start:prod
```

# ‚úÖ TODO

[ ] Add code of conduct file  
[ ] Add docker section to make project working through docker  
[ ] Add project files structure  
[ ] Add issue template file  
[ ] Check if env variables are loading correctly using
[schema-validation](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/configuration#schema-validation)  
[ ] Track errors in production. Use [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) or similar

Observation: Some TODOS are spread across the code and need to be fixed ASAP
